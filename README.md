# 🎮 Randint Guess Game

Welcome to the **Randint Guess Game**, a fun and interactive **level-based number guessing game** built with Python. Each level increases the difficulty, making it more challenging and exciting as you go!

## 🚀 How It Works

- The game randomly selects a number between 1 and `10 × level`.
- You keep guessing until you get it right.
- After each correct guess, you're asked whether you want to proceed to the next level.
- Each new level increases the range of numbers to guess from.
